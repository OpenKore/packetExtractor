#packetExtractor

Thanks Bryan Wai for creating this project.

Now this is an official Packet Extractor under OpenKore. At this stage, we guarantee to work in twRO only. If you would like to implement this into other servers, I would suggest you to check whether those function calls are in the same place as we have in twRO.
